**E-Waste Generation Classification (Week 1 Submission) | AICTE Internship Project**

This repository contains the Week 1 work for the ongoing AICTE Virtual Internship on Artificial Intelligence. The goal of the project is to build an image classification model to identify and categorize e-waste from images using deep learning techniques.

In this week’s submission, we have laid the foundational work by implementing transfer learning with EfficientNetV2B0 and deploying a basic prototype using Gradio.

📌 Objective
To classify e-waste types (e.g., mobile phones, keyboards, circuit boards, etc.) using a deep learning model trained on labeled images.

✅ Week 1 Accomplishments

📦 Imported and set up all necessary libraries (TensorFlow, Keras, Gradio, etc.)

🧠 Integrated EfficientNetV2B0 for transfer learning

🖼️ Included image preprocessing pipeline

📈 Implemented metrics like confusion matrix and classification report

🌐 Created a basic Gradio demo interface to preview the classification setup

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

EfficientNetV2B0 (pre-trained model)

Gradio (for interface)

NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

PIL (for image handling)

📂 Current File
AICTE internship.py: Python script with the model setup, basic training/evaluation pipeline, and a web interface via Gradio.

🚧 Future Work (Upcoming Weeks)
📊 Train the model on a curated e-waste dataset

🧪 Improve model performance with hyperparameter tuning

🎯 Add custom labels and support for multi-class classification

🌍 Deploy final version on cloud (e.g., Hugging Face, Render, etc.)

📋 Create a detailed project report and video demo
